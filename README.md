# clip_share

A Flutter application to sync clipboard between computer and phone.

• ClipShare is a tool to sync clipboard of mobile and computer.
• When clipboard data is changed on any device, it’ll send to other
end using socket.
• I used flutter framework to create mobile app which will act as
client and Java server for computer. Since java is platform independent
and flutter can create cross-platform app, this tool can
be used on any platform.
